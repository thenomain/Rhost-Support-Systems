/*

The README.md in this folder is meant to act as the installer for all the 
starter functions I've created or gathered. They are in a vague order wherein I 
believe it's the most- to least-important.

There is much more information in each one of these files to explain the how- or 
why- or even, in some cases, things you have to do to install it properly on 
your game.

With the exception of width(), all of these should be viable for both Rhost and 
TinyMUX and maybe even PennMUSH.

As long as it and this are maintained, clicking the link below should give you a 
simple bunch of text to copy and paste into your favorite Mushlike client.
